2. Storytelling Design: The layout often guides users through a narrative, making it ideal for portfolios, landing pages, or promotional sites.

3. Interactive Elements: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and animated graphics add to the user engagement.

4. Responsive Design: Optimized for devices of all sizes, ensuring the effect looks stunning on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

5. Modern Aesthetics: Combines sleek typography, vibrant visuals, and clean layouts to offer a professional and polished appearance.
